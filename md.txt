If we do, we’ll ask you to upload it.\n\nIf you aren’t able to fit all of this information into one image, you can take 2 screenshots. They both need to show your bank account number to confirm the information is for the same account.\n\n**Proof of payment in Australia and New Zealand**\n\nIf your bank is in Australia or New Zealand, we need more than just a screenshot of your online banking. We’ll also need a recent bank statement showing your name, date of issue, and bank details.\n\nYou can also just send us the bank statement, and not the online banking screenshot, if it shows all the details listed above.\n\n#### Was this article helpful?\n\nYes No\n#### Related articles\n\n* [Retrieving your Proof of Payment from Japanese Bank Account](/help/articles/589256uvJXproEEDbYOkwo/retrieving-your-proof-of-payment-from-japanese-bank-account?origin=related-article-2932689)\n* [I forgot the reference](/help/articles/2932690/i-forgot-the-reference?origin=related-article-2932689)\n* [How can I check the status of my transfer?](/help/articles/2452305/how-can-i-check-the-status-of-my-transfer?origin=related-article-2932689)\n* [What documents can I upload to prove my income?](/help/articles/pzAbygC8P76ls7RHw7Gko/what-documents-can-i-upload-to-prove-my-income?origin=related-article-2932689)\n* [Can I send from a joint bank account?](/help/articles/2977993/can-i-send-from-a-joint-bank-account?origin=related-article-2932689)\n", "https://wise.com/help/articles/2977950/why-does-it-say-my-transfers-complete-when-the-money-hasnt-arrived-yet": "Why does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet? | Wise Help Centre[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/flag.svg)](/)[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/logo.svg)](/)[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)EN[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)\n\n* [Help home](/help)\n* Sending money\n\nWhy does it say my transfer's complete when the money hasn't arrived yet?\n=========================================================================\n\nWe mark your transfer **Complete** when we’ve sent the money to the recipient bank. And we leave a little room in our arrival estimate for the bank to process and release it.\n\nIf your recipient says they haven’t yet received the money, there are two possible reasons why.\n\n#### 1. The receiving bank is still processing the money\n\nBut some banks are slower than others — they might take up to 1 working day for them to release the money. So your money’s safely on its way, but the recipient bank is still processing it. Your recipient can ask their bank to speed this up. They’ll need a transfer receipt that has all the details.\n\n[Learn how to download a transfer receipt](/help/articles/2977946/how-do-i-download-a-transfer-receipt)\n\n#### 2. The money has arrived, but it looks a bit different\n\nYour recipient might not recognise the transfer when it arrives in their account. Using the transfer receipt, we recommend they check:\n\n* **The sender name and reference.** Your recipient should look for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they won’t see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our banking partners. In this case, they can identify it from the reference number.\n* **The currency and amount.** Your recipient’s account might be in a different currency than the one you’ve sent them. In this case, their bank will convert the money again, and the amount might be different than expected.\n\n#### Was this article helpful?\n\nYes No\n#### Related articles\n\n* [When will my money arrive?](/help/articles/2941900/when-will-my-money-arrive?origin=related-article-2977950)\n* [Why do some transfers take longer?](/help/articles/2977951/why-do-some-transfers-take-longer?origin=related-article-2977950)\n* [My money hasn’t arrived in my Wise balance](/help/articles/2977937/my-money-hasnt-arrived-in-my-wise-balance?origin=related-article-2977950)\n* [What are Swift correspondent fees when sending and receiving money?](/help/articles/3KEJruODkhi59TZbSxO2xn/what-are-swift-correspondent-fees-when-sending-and-receiving-money?origin=related-article-2977950)\n* [Why was my transfer cancelled?](/help/articles/2971425/why-was-my-transfer-cancelled?origin=related-article-2977950)\n", "https://wise.com/help/articles/2977951/why-do-some-transfers-take-longer": "Why do some transfers take longer? | Wise Help Centre[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/flag.svg)](/)[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/logo.svg)](/)[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)EN[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)\n\n* [Help home](/help)\n* Sending money\n\nWhy do some transfers take longer?\n==================================\n\nWe try to send your transfer out as soon as possible, but sometimes, it might take longer. Here are some things that can affect how long your transfer takes, and what to do.\n\nWe’ll always tell you upfront when your money should arrive, and send you updates via email once the transfer is on its way. Note that any transfer with conversion can take 2 working days to process.\n\n[Track your transfer](https://wise.com/user/account) to see the latest status.\n\n**Payment method**\n------------------\n\nHow you paid for your transfer can affect how long it takes to send, because some options are faster than others. We’ll always show you how long each payment method takes when you’re setting up your transfer. Conversion between currencies can always take up to 2 working days.\n\n**Paying by card**\n\nIf you paid by card, we can start your transfer straight away, because card payments are usually instant. They might sometimes be pending, so you can check your transfer status by logging into Wise.\n\n**Paying by bank**\n\nBanks can take longer depending on your currency. For example, it might take 2 working days to process your transfer, and longer if it falls on a holiday.\n\n**Paying by Swift**\n\nIf you make a Swift transfer, which is a global payment that uses multiple banks, we’ll need to wait until we get your money. This could take 2–5 working days, and we can’t control the speed as other banks are involved.\n\nPayment methods are also different for different currencies. Some currencies are faster than others, so read our Help Centre articles on your currency to find out how long yours can take.\n\n[Learn more about Swift transfers](/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift)\n\n**Weekends and holidays**\n-------------------------\n\nOnce we’ve received your money, we convert it to the new currency and send it out. But banking hours, weekends, and public holidays are out of our control — so this might slow down the process.\n\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\n\nSo if your transfer is urgent, plan around weekends and public holidays.\n\n**Mistake in your recipient details**\n-------------------------------------\n\nWe all make mistakes, and sometimes we might input one wrong digit or misspell a name. If this happens, the recipient's bank will likely reject the payment and it will be sent back to your account details by that bank. This can take up to a few days depending on the currency, payment method, and whether it's outside of the bank's working hours.\n\n**Security checks**\n-------------------\n\nFrom time to time, we need to run security checks on all of our customers and their payments. This is because we're a regulated financial institution, and are required to review transfers by law. We might need to verify things like your ID, address, or where you got the money from, when you make a transfer. [These additional checks can add extra time](/help/articles/2977963/how-long-will-extra-checks-on-my-transfer-take) to your transfer.\n\nYou can't speed this up, and we'll get in touch if we need anything from you, but you can always check the status of your transfer from the web or app.\n\n**Banks processing payments**\n-----------------------------\n\nAfter we send your money out to your recipient’s bank, the bank will then process and clear the money. But some banks are faster than others — it might take up to 2 working days for some currencies. At this point, the money’s out of our system, so we can’t control how they manage the payment, but the bank should be able to help.\n\nYour recipient can ask the receiving bank to clear the money faster. Just share the [transfer receipt](/help/articles/2977946/how-do-i-download-a-transfer-receipt) with your recipient that they can show their bank to get information. We can’t share any details about the sent payment with your recipient directly.\n\nWe’re trying to identify the banks that are slower, so we can give you a more accurate estimate. If you’d like to help, you can [let us know when the money arrived](https://wise.com/delivery-feedback).\n\n#### Was this article helpful?\n\nYes No\n#### Related articles\n\n* [How long does a transfer usually take?](/help/articles/2524078/how-long-does-a-transfer-usually-take?origin=related-article-2977951)\n* [Guide to NZD transfers](/help/articles/2955297/guide-to-nzd-transfers?origin=related-article-2977951)\n* [Guide to SEK transfers](/help/articles/2932342/guide-to-sek-transfers?origin=related-article-2977951)\n* [Guide to DKK transfers](/help/articles/2932339/guide-to-dkk-transfers?origin=related-article-2977951)\n* [Guide to CAD transfers](/help/articles/2932153/guide-to-cad-transfers?origin=related-article-2977951)\n", "https://wise.com/help/articles/2941900/when-will-my-money-arrive": "When will my money arrive? | Wise Help Centre[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/flag.svg)](/)[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/logo.svg)](/)[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)EN[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)\n\n* [Help home](/help)\n* Sending money\n\nWhen will my money arrive?\n==========================\n\nWhen you make a transfer, we’ll give you an estimate for when your money should arrive. But, there are a few situations where you might have questions about timing. Here are some tips to help you understand when it’ll arrive, or why it’s delayed.\n\n### Wise says that my transfer’s due to arrive today.\n\nGreat! Really that means your money should’ve arrived already. We say that it’s due today because some banks need a few hours to process transfers from us.\n\n### My recipient’s details may be wrong.\n\nSmall things like typos in names — for instance, spelling John Smith as Jon Smith — shouldn’t be a problem for most countries. Your money should still arrive on time. However, for some currencies, such as JPY, a typo like this can be an issue.\n\nIf something like [an account number is wrong](/help/articles/2448406/i-got-my-recipients-bank-details-wrong), your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us. If your money does get returned to us, we’ll let you know straight away.\n\n### Transfers on weekends and holidays.\n\nNot all countries have banking systems that work on weekends or holidays. Our delivery times factor in banking hours of the country you’re sending money to.\n\nBut in some parts of the world, banks stop processing transfers early on Fridays.\n\nThat means, if your money’s due to arrive on Friday, it may not show in your recipient’s account until the next working day. We’re working to find out which banks do this, and make our delivery estimates more accurate in the process.\n\n### My recipient says the money hasn’t arrived yet.\n\nWe hope to never put you in this position. If your recipient says they haven’t received your money yet, please ask them to check the following:\n\n* **The sender name they’re looking for.** Your recipient can try looking for a transaction on their bank statement from Wise — they might not see your name. The transfer might also come from one of our partners, but the amount and reference should still help find the payout.\n* **The recipient’s bank details.** If they’re not right, your money could take longer to arrive, or get returned to us.\n* **The currency the recipient’s account is in.** Your recipient’s account may be in a currency that’s different to the one you’ve sent them. If that’s the case, they could get a different amount from us because their bank might have converted the money.\n\n### Getting a receipt.\n\nYour recipient’s bank may be having problems processing your transfer. They’ll have the money in their system, but won’t have put it into your recipient’s account.\n\nOur receipt includes all our bank details and, for some currencies, tracking numbers too. That means when your recipient gives it to their bank, the bank should have all the info they need to track down your transfer.\n\n#### **Here’s how to get your receipt:**\n\n1. Log into your Wise account\n2. Click on your transfer\n3. Click on the 3 dots on your browser to see a **Get PDF receipt** button, or click the button directly in the app\n4. Save it to your device and send it to your recipient\n   \n   ---\n\nInterest, Stocks or Yield\n-------------------------\n\nIf you sent money using Wise Interest or Stocks there are thresholds for how much you can send each day without an added delay.\n\nCheck the relevant page below based on your account type and where you or your business are for more information.\n\n#### **For personal customers in the EEA**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (EEA)](/help/articles/7pPRhckOJeSULjGZtvszLW/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (EEA)](/help/articles/jXE1YMQTLw1otdATxBTOc/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars-eea)\n\n#### **For business customers in the EEA**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (EEA Businesses)](/help/articles/4i3hetxXNq1XE4ui19AIQQ/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-eea-business)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (EEA Business Customers)](/help/articles/225jgGVR439TjwUwCSPA0D/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars-eea-business-customers)\n\n#### **For personal customers in the UK**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (UK)](/help/articles/4T0tnMciFqJFmBLPKm9NIf/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-uk)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (UK)](/help/articles/5NALri9Ev1C7hrkPpHPzTz/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars-uk)\n\n#### **For business customers in the UK**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (UK Business Customers)](/help/articles/6H57JNPrt8I590yAYJix7B/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-uk-business-customers)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (UK Business Customers)](/help/articles/7gSzxjUKlXvz1TtTxbdPzA/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars-uk-business-customers)\n\n#### **For personal customers in Singapore**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (SG)](/help/articles/1MbYcrnXTMy6sF35GnqijY/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-sg)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (Singapore)](/help/articles/PnxCmRyHjEAWnn4UkMPUa/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars)\n\n#### **For business customers in Singapore**\n\n* [Transferring from Interest balances or Jars (Singapore Business Customers)](/help/articles/wvQhLbUgwlasKPIFLurOT/transferring-from-interest-balances-or-jars-singapore-business-customers)\n* [Transferring from Stocks balances or Jars (Singapore Business Customers)](/help/articles/NearjA2W6cnnwTTnXmQCG/transferring-from-stocks-balances-or-jars-singapore-business-customers)\n\n### **For personal customers in Australia**\n\n* [Transferring from Yield balances or Jars (AU)](/help/articles/7ifmoVPZmPPlbzljZPe2G3/transferring-from-yield-balances-or-jars-au)\n\n#### Was this article helpful?\n\nYes No\n#### Related articles\n\n* [What are Jars and how can I keep money in them?](/help/articles/2978074/what-are-jars-and-how-can-i-keep-money-in-them?origin=related-article-2941900)\n* [How do I use Interest and Stocks?](/help/articles/74dYRhMCItIf2IBJLTpFQs/how-do-i-use-interest-and-stocks?origin=related-article-2941900)\n* [Avoiding unexpected processing time for Stocks transfers (UK Business Customers)](/help/articles/2NdFl9rnCXOd38zIL0wYgQ/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-stocks-transfers-uk-business-customers?origin=related-article-2941900)\n* [Avoiding unexpected processing time for Interest transfers (UK Business Customers)](/help/articles/65NOpf5iS8Y55sMp3uO8Lt/avoiding-unexpected-processing-time-for-interest-transfers-uk-business-customers?origin=related-article-2941900)\n* [Sending and spending limits if you live in Singapore](/help/articles/7An4EGbMZwNgDIFa35QFM9/sending-and-spending-limits-if-you-live-in-singapore?origin=related-article-2941900)\n", "https://wise.com/help/articles/2977938/whats-a-banking-partner-reference-number": "What's a banking partner reference number? | Wise Help Centre[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/flag.svg)](/)[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/logo.svg)](/)[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)EN[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)\n\n* [Help home](/help)\n* Sending money\n\nWhat's a banking partner reference number?\n==========================================\n\nFor every transfer you send with Wise, we give you a transfer number, which you can use if you need to [get in touch with us](https://wise.com/help/contact).\n\nFor some transfers, we’ll also give you a banking partner reference number. It’s called this because we send out your money through local banking partners in each country.\n\n### How do I use the banking partner reference number?\n\nGive the banking partner reference number to your recipient. They can use the banking partner reference number to see where the transfer is once it’s shown as completed on your Wise account.\n\nThe recipient will need to give this number to the recipient’s bank if they get in touch with them.\n\nIn different countries, banks might call it something else. For example, in India, banks sometimes call it a UTR (Unique Transaction Reference) number, or a transaction reference number.\n\n#### Was this article helpful?\n\nYes No\n#### Related articles\n\n* [Guide to THB transfers](/help/articles/2932335/guide-to-thb-transfers?origin=related-article-2977938)\n* [Where can I find my membership number?](/help/articles/EH3QWCqKbrkRXhYbVbm4y/where-can-i-find-my-membership-number?origin=related-article-2977938)\n* [Sending with Swift](/help/articles/5Fwvk7KFzbTBohJiUu0Ryd/sending-with-swift?origin=related-article-2977938)\n* [Guide to KRW transfers](/help/articles/2932331/guide-to-krw-transfers?origin=related-article-2977938)\n* [How do I download a transfer receipt?](/help/articles/2977946/how-do-i-download-a-transfer-receipt?origin=related-article-2977938)\n", "https://wise.com/help/articles/2452305/how-can-i-check-the-status-of-my-transfer": "How can I check the status of my transfer? | Wise Help Centre[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/flag.svg)](/)[![Wise](/public-resources/assets/logos/wise-personal/logo.svg)](/)[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)EN[Log in](/login/)[Register](/register/)\n\n* [Help home](/help)\n* Sending money\n\nHow can I check the status of my transfer?\n==========================================\n\nFor every transfer you set up, we try to give you as much information as possible in our money tracker.

Click **Details** on the transfer you’d like to track\n\nToday, we deliver over 80% of transfers within 2 hours of the estimated time you see on the money tracker. But sometimes, it can take a little longer. Here are some of the most common reasons why your transfer might be delayed, and what you can do about them.\n\n### We might need to verify you\n\nDepending on how much you send and what currency you send to, we may need to do some extra verification. If we do, we’ll send you an email letting you know what information we need. So, keep an eye on your emails whenever you set up a transfer.\n\n### The recipient’s bank might be processing the transfer\n\nWhen the money tracker says **Transfer Sent**, it means Wise has sent out your money. But, it can still take a few working days for it to reach the recipient’s bank, and for them to process it. The extra time it takes also depends on the currency you’re sending to. [Check your currency for how long it can take for the money to arrive to your recipient.](/help/articles/2571907/what-currencies-can-i-send-to-and-from)\n\n### There’s a mistake in the recipient’s details\n\nSometimes, transfers get delayed because there’s a mistake in the recipient’s details. When this happens, some banks can still process the transfer, but it takes a little longer for them to match it to the right account. Other times, they’ll send the money back to us and we’ll ask you to send it again.\n\nIf your transfer is taking longer than you expect, double check the recipient’s details. Here’s [what to do if you made a mistake](/help/articles/2448406/i-got-my-recipients-bank-details-wrong).\n\n### It's a weekend or holiday\n\nIf you're sending money over the weekend or before a holiday, it may only get processed the next working day. This is because we work with banks, and can only send money when they're open. You can check the status of your transfer in the app.\n\n### What do I do now?\n\nIf we have paid out your money, but it hasn’t settled in your recipient’s account yet, you can speed up the process by sending a transfer receipt to the recipient’s bank.\n\n1. Go to **Home** to see your activity list\n2. Click on **Details** on the relevant transfer\n3. Click **Get PDF receipt**\n4.
